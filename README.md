# Genetic-Neural-Network
A simple hybrid of NN and GA - GNN. Everything is made from scratch (without PyTorch, Tensorflow/Keras, DEAP, etc); only numpy and scikit (just to create the blobs dataset)

*Still in progress...*<br /><br />

P.S. The code is quite messy since I was planning this project as a little experiment, even though every function/method got my comments on its functionality :)
